# The Great TDD & Mob Programming Experiment

Base project to run a TDD and Mob Programming meeting. Simple coding tasks in classes with matching test classes.

## Mob Programming
Mob programming is pair programming taken to the next step. Instead of two developers working together on a problem, it is the entire team of developers. Generally one person drives, or people take turns driving, while everyone contributes in writing the code to solve the problem.

Benefits:
* Knowledge sharing
	* Everyone on the team has knowledge of what is being worked on because they are all working on it
* Best practices established
	* Easier to decide on best practices, formatting choices when everyone is working together
* Short feedback loops
	* Code is peer reviewed as it is being written
	* Context for the changes are current in everyones mind,
* Team is more resiliant
	* Sick time? Unplanned absences? The rest of the team is already up to speed and actively working on what's in progress
* Better communication and collaberation

## Test Driven Development

Test driven development is a software development process in which closely integrates development and testing. The process in traditionally to write a test to verify some interaction or functionality. Then the code is written to fulfill that test case, usually aiming for the smallest, most conceise change possible to make the test pass.

Benefits:
* Short feedback loop between writing code and running code
* Refactoring while writing keeps code cleaner
* Tests are written with the code and document interactions with the code
* Higher productivity


## Experiment

### Setup
1. The Driver - the computer hooked up to a TV/Projector
2. The Mob -  everyone else with laptops and a view of the driver's screen
3. Everyone in a shared collaborative editing workspace (we're going to try floobits.com)

### The Driver
The main responsibilities of the driver will be to lead the mob and to write the actual code for the program. The driver will attempt to write the smallest amount of code possible to get the tests to pass.

### The Mob
The mobs resposibility is to steer the driver in creating the best solution. This is done by collaborating to write tests that would define the desired behavior of the program.

### Goals
* Show how TDD and Mob programming can produce well written code
* Give everyone on the team experience with writing tests and thinking in a test-first way when developing
* Get everyone together to see how we collaborate as a team and see if it is something we should be doing more of
* Try out new collaboration software and see if it might be useful
