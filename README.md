# The Great TDD & Mob Programming Experiment

Base project to run a TDD and Mob Programming meeting. Simple coding tasks in classes with matching test classes.

## Mob Programming
Mob programming is pair programming taken to the next step. Instead of two developers working together on a problem, it is the entire team of developers. Generally one person drives, or people take turns driving, while everyone contributes in writing the code to solve the problem.

General benefits:
* Knowledge sharing
	* Everyone on the team has knowledge of what is being worked on because they are all working on it
* Best practices established
	* Easier to decide on best practices, formatting choices when everyone is working together
* Short feedback loops
	* Code is peer reviewed as it is being written
	* Context for the changes are current in everyones mind,
* Team is more resiliant
	* Sick time? Unplanned absences? The rest of the team is already up to speed and actively working on what's in progress
* Better communication and collaberation

## Test Driven Development

Test driven development is a software development process in which closely integrates development and testing. The process in traditionally to write a test to verify some interaction or functionality. Then the code is written to fulfill that test case, usually aiming for the smallest, most conceise change possible to make the test pass.
